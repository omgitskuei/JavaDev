# JavaDev

This repo is my notebook of various exercises, prototypes, applets, and notes.

The contents can be mini applets like calculating differences between two times, notes
on libraries I've recently been learning to use, notes on unintuitive code behaviors
(unintuitive to me), or half-complete projects for practicing using specific design
patterns, or refactoring monolithic codebase into more readable and less repetitive methods, modules, and util classes.

Notes can be an in-depth look at various vanilla Java libraries and how similar tools differ, while others could be a template code for future copy-pasting with little
explanations.
