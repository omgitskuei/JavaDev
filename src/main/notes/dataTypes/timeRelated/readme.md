## Classes for handling time
---
This folder contains java classes designed for handling time that I have used before in 
software development.
Each Java file named in this format "Using[NameOfClass]" is an executable Java file
(contains "public static void main(String[] args)") that showcases common use-cases
with the class. 
Common use-cases is defined as:
- initializing a specific time
- converting between two times
- calculating the elapsed difference between two times
- presenting a time in various formats
