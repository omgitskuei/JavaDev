Change Log - 4/12

Reasons for pushing for Version 2:
1) 
One of the main reasons for improving on TimeElapse and writing a version 2 is to change 
the Java API used for calculating time differences from Java.util.Calendar to Java.Time
(Java 8 and later). Java.Time should simplify the codebase and lower parsing exceptions.

2)
Another reason is to expand the scope of the program to calculate time elapsed between
two date-times as opposed to two times in the same day. More complex but more useful.

3)
Change the UI from JTextFields (think <input type=text/>) to 
JComboBox<String> (think <select><option>something<option></select>).
JComboBox limits the possibility of user entering garbage data compared to a JTextField.
Won't have to worry about whether "puppy" is a parse-able date-time.
Instead, only need to validate whether Feb 29, 30, 31, April 31, May 31, June 31, etc
are valid dates, which the new API Java.Time can handle.
