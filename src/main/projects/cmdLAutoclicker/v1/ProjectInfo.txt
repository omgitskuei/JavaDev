Problem
-------
Computer at work will self-lock after an undetermined duration of inactivity.
Inactivity is defined as no keyboard input as well as no mouse input.
User finds repeatedly unlocking the computer 'inactivity' frustrating,
since these gaps could actually be halfway through reading documentation, etc.

Goal
----
Design a program that automatically clicks the mouse to break periods of inactivity
and prevent computer from self-locking. The clicking intervals need to be somewhat 
random to not arouse suspicion, assuming the computer has employee management software
installed.

Scope
-----
The program should be light weight and configurable.
No UI is needed to meet user needs, CMDL is fine.
