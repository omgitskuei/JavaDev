Problem
-------
Guild Wars 2 gameplay drops materials collectively called "T5 trophies" often and clog
up inventory space. They're made more spatially efficient as well as more valuable if
promoted from T5 to T6 trophies. The primary reason this isn't done more often by
players is because the promotion process is a mindless and tedious chore of repetitive
clicking.

Goal
----
Design a program with GUI (graphical user interface) that allows users to intuitively
create new automation routines related to the mouse. 
This includes automatically:
1) moving the mouse, 
2) clicking the mouse, 
3) waiting a user specified number of seconds before the next action, if any.

Scope
-----
The program should have a number of GUI components that let user add new actions 
including waits - this may be JButtons & JTextFields.
The program should have a JTextArea that is Not editable for displaying the current 
queued actions in the routine.
The program should have a Clear all actions and/or Remove last action JButton.
The program should have an Execute routine JButton.

Future design spaces
--------------------
The program can be expanded to:
- Save the routine to a text file (.txt).
- Open a text file and run the routine from the text file. if it is parsed correctly.
- Support adding keyboard actions to the routine.
