NOTE:
Files owners.txt and prizes.txt does not need the file extension ".txt" 
when creating new File() in Raffle.parseOwners(), Raffle.parsePrizes().

Wanted to implement selecting elements from map using UUID but that
didn't work out because Collections.shuffle() does not work with Maps.
Without .shuffle(), would need random index selection of elements.

Would be interesting to implement allowing mmultiple prizes per ticket,
but currently not needed as it's easy to issue more tickets per owner
for the same effect.

TO-DO:
Write console log results into a results.txt
Write debug log into a debug.log, if debug=true
