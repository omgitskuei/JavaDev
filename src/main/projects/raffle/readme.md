# Raffle, Project Info
---
Annually, my Guild Wars 2 raiding party holds two raffles for our members. This is an initiative I started to 
encourage players to play with the raid group long-term, and this applies to both core members of the group as
well as players that 'fill' (come along and cover squad openings on short notice if core members do not show
to raid). The Raffle should also motivate players to play better during raids because the prize pool grows
when players commit mistakes. This has the added benefit that when mistakes happen, others who did not commit
the mistake are indirectly compensated through the raffle for their time.

The Raffle program has been in effect since 2021 and has distributed prizes twice so far. The total value of 
the distributed prize so far (as of Sept 2022) is between 78 and 100 gold considering inflation.

The efficacy of this strategy to lower raider turnover is limited in reality, where 8 out of 9 players that 
left did so regardless of how close to the raffle their retirement is, as of Sept 2022).
That said, what is very obvious is the positive effect the Raffle program has in dispelling frustrations 
arising from mistakes, since people will apologize but now also pledge to donate to the prize pool for their 
mistake. This donation mechanism is currently done largely voluntarily, so some people will end up donating 
more simply because they are more generous not necessarily because they make more mistakes and perform worse.
An example would be two players making 3 mistakes each - the first player feels the need to donate 3 times, 
whereas the second player only donated 2 times.
Whether players donate to the prize pool depends in part also on the nature of the mistake. If the mistake 
is almost entirely Neglect as opposed to Inexperience or Failure of Execution, then a donation may be even 
demanded of by the commander, though this Negligence type of mistake is generally rare.

Because of the Raffle program's goal to be a vehicle that:
- Promotes long-term commitment,
- Encourages players to perform better by penalizing mistakes,
- Compensates other players for wasted time and reward good plays, 
- Incentivizes contractor players to fill open slots,

the Raffle program distributes in a way where each player will win some prize, but each player may get 
different amounts of the prize and may receive prizes of different value from others. This way, everyone 
'wins' but a few 'lucky' players will 'win' more.

### Goal
---
Design a program that distributes a prize pool to a group of individuals for the Raffle program.

### Scope
---
I will be the main target user so the scope is flexible. The result of the draw must be easy to
copy-paste.
For each version of the program, there may be different scopes.

### Future design spaces
---
For each version of the program, there may be different design spaces.

### Change logs
---
Below are major dates. See version specific change logs in their own readme.md.
